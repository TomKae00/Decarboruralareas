# Decarbonization Strategies for District Heating Networks

This repository is part of my Bachelor thesis, titled "Decarbonisation Strategies of District Heating Networks in Rural Regions." The project contains a model to determine the best decarbonization possibilities for existing district heating networks in Brandenburg, Germany, based on the open-source library PyPSA.

Feel free to use anything from this work for your own purposes. I will continue to develop and enhance the code, as well as improve the documentation over time.
